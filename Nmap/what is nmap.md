Nmap (Network Mapper) is a free and open-source network exploration and security auditing tool. It is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network, thus creating a "map" of the network. Nmap is designed to be a versatile tool that can be used for a variety of tasks, including network inventory, monitoring, and vulnerability assessment.

Nmap uses a variety of scanning techniques to identify hosts and services, such as ping scans, port scans, and version detection. It can also be used to fingerprint operating systems and detect software vulnerabilities. Nmap can be used from a command line interface or through a graphical user interface (GUI) such as Zenmap.

Nmap is widely used by security professionals, system administrators, and network engineers to secure and maintain their computer networks. Its flexibility and extensive feature set make it a powerful tool for network exploration and vulnerability assessment.
