The Nessus Attack Scripting Language, also known as NASL, is a scripting language designed specifically for vulnerability scanners like Nessus and OpenVAS.

* **Purpose:** NASL allows you to automate vulnerability checks based on known weaknesses. It facilitates writing custom scripts or plugins that Nessus can execute to identify vulnerabilities on target systems. 
* **Functionality:**  
    * NASL provides an interface for writing tests to probe for vulnerabilities.
    * It offers functions for network communication, allowing scripts to interact with target systems using various protocols.
    * NASL is designed for ease of use and rapid development. Scripts don't require compilation, enabling faster creation and testing cycles.
* **Applications:**
    * Thousands of pre-written NASL plugins exist for Nessus and OpenVAS, addressing a vast array of vulnerabilities.
    * NASL's ability to handle custom scripting is particularly useful for:
        * Creating plugins to detect new or zero-day vulnerabilities.
        * Tailoring vulnerability checks to specific environments.

Some additional points to consider:

* NASL is a proprietary language developed by Tenable, the company behind Nessus. 
* While earlier Nessus versions offered a standalone NASL interpreter, current versions rely on an API for NASL execution.
* Resources for learning NASL include the official Tenable documentation and online communities focused on security testing.
