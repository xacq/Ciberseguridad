The Sasser worm is a notable computer worm that targeted Windows operating systems, specifically Windows XP and Windows 2000. It spread rapidly by exploiting a vulnerability in the Microsoft Windows LSASS service (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) over TCP port 445.

1. **Exploiting LSASS Vulnerability:**
   - The Sasser worm exploited a buffer overflow vulnerability in the LSASS service. This vulnerability allowed remote code execution on vulnerable Windows systems.
   - The worm sent specially crafted packets to TCP port 445, triggering the buffer overflow in LSASS.

2. **Infection and Propagation:**
   - Once a vulnerable system received the malicious packet and LSASS was exploited, the Sasser worm gained control of the system.
   - The worm then copied itself to the Windows system folder with a randomly generated file name (e.g., `avserve.exe`, `skynetave.exe`) to avoid detection.
   - It created a registry entry to ensure its execution at system startup, ensuring persistence after a reboot.

3. **Scanning and Infecting Other Systems:**
   - The worm scanned IP addresses on the local network and the internet to find other vulnerable systems.
   - It attempted to connect to discovered systems on TCP port 445 to exploit the LSASS vulnerability and infect them.

4. **System Impact:**
   - Infected systems experienced slowdowns and instability due to the worm's activities, including high CPU and network usage.
   - Some variants of the Sasser worm caused system crashes or the infamous "LSASS.EXE - System Error" message, leading to system restarts.

5. **Mitigation and Removal:**
   - Microsoft released security patches (MS04-011 and MS04-012) to address the LSASS vulnerability exploited by Sasser.
   - Antivirus vendors also provided updates to detect and remove the Sasser worm from infected systems.
   - Manual removal involved identifying and terminating the malicious processes, deleting related files, and removing registry entries.

6. **Lessons Learned:**
   - Sasser highlighted the importance of promptly applying security patches to mitigate vulnerabilities.
   - It also underscored the need for robust network security measures to prevent unauthorized access and limit the spread of malware.

The Sasser worm was a significant cybersecurity incident that affected millions of Windows systems worldwide, emphasizing the critical role of patch management and proactive security practices.
