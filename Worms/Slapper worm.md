The Slapper worm, also known as the Apache/mod_ssl Worm, was a computer worm that targeted Linux systems running the Apache web server with the mod_ssl module. It was first discovered in September 2002 and caused significant disruption to servers worldwide.

Here are some key points about the Slapper worm:

1. **Target:** The worm specifically targeted systems running Linux with vulnerable versions of the Apache web server that had the mod_ssl module installed. This module provided SSL/TLS encryption support for Apache.

2. **Vulnerability Exploited:** The Slapper worm exploited a vulnerability in the mod_ssl module known as the "OpenSSL Malformed Handshake" vulnerability (CVE-2002-0656). This vulnerability allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the target system.

3. **Propagation:** The worm spread by scanning for vulnerable systems on the Internet. Once it identified a vulnerable system, it would exploit the OpenSSL vulnerability to install a copy of itself on the target system.

4. **Payload:** After infecting a system, the worm installed a peer-to-peer (P2P) network on the compromised machine. This network was used for command and control (C&C) communication among infected systems.

5. **DDoS Attacks:** One of the primary purposes of the Slapper worm was to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Infected systems were used to participate in coordinated DDoS attacks against target websites or servers, leading to service disruptions.

6. **Patch and Cleanup:** The Slapper worm prompted a widespread effort to patch vulnerable systems and remove the worm from infected servers. Security patches for Apache and OpenSSL were released to address the underlying vulnerabilities.

7. **Impact:** The Slapper worm caused significant disruptions to Internet services and highlighted the importance of promptly applying security patches to mitigate the risk of such widespread attacks.

8. **Lessons Learned:** The Slapper worm incident underscored the need for proactive security measures, including regular patching of software, network segmentation to limit the spread of malware, and robust intrusion detection and response mechanisms.

While the Slapper worm is now considered a historical threat, its impact on cybersecurity practices and the importance of vulnerability management remains relevant today.
