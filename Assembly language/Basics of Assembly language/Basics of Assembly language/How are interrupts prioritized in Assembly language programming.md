In assembly language programming, interrupt prioritization is typically determined by the hardware architecture of the processor. Different processors and architectures may have different mechanisms for handling interrupts and assigning priorities. Here are some common approaches:

### 1. **Interrupt Vector Table (IVT):**

   - Many processors use an Interrupt Vector Table, which is a data structure that maps interrupt numbers to their corresponding interrupt service routines (ISRs).
   - The order of entries in the IVT can indicate the priority of interrupts. Lower-numbered entries often correspond to higher-priority interrupts.
   - When an interrupt occurs, the processor looks up the corresponding entry in the IVT to find the address of the ISR to execute.

### 2. **Interrupt Priority Registers:**

   - Some processors have dedicated registers or flags that indicate the priority level of the current interrupt being processed.
   - These registers might be used to set and compare interrupt priorities, allowing the processor to determine which interrupt to handle first based on priority levels.

### 3. **Interrupt Nesting:**

   - Some architectures support interrupt nesting, where a higher-priority interrupt can preempt the execution of a lower-priority interrupt.
   - The processor keeps track of the interrupt nesting level, and the ISR of the highest-priority interrupt at the current nesting level is executed.

### 4. **Interrupt Controller:**

   - In systems with multiple interrupt sources, an interrupt controller may be used to manage and prioritize interrupts.
   - The interrupt controller receives interrupt requests from various sources and determines the order in which they are serviced based on their priority levels.

### 5. **Software Prioritization:**

   - In some cases, the priority of interrupts is determined by software. The software may explicitly prioritize certain interrupt requests over others.
   - This prioritization might be implemented in the interrupt service routine or in a separate system configuration routine.

### 6. **Interrupt Priority Levels:**

   - Some processors define multiple interrupt priority levels, and interrupts are assigned to specific levels.
   - The processor may be configured to ignore interrupts below a certain priority level when a higher-priority interrupt is being serviced.

### 7. **Fixed-Priority vs. Programmable Priority:**

   - Some systems have fixed interrupt priorities that are hardwired into the hardware.
   - Others allow programmable priorities, where software can dynamically adjust the priority levels of interrupts.

### **Note:**

It's important to consult the documentation for the specific processor or microcontroller being used, as the mechanisms for interrupt prioritization can vary widely between different architectures. Assembly language programmers need to be aware of these mechanisms to write efficient and reliable interrupt service routines.
