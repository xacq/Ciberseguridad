**Opcode** in assembly language stands for "Operation Code." It is a fundamental component of machine-level instructions that the central processing unit (CPU) executes. The opcode specifies the operation or action that the CPU should perform. Each assembly language instruction consists of an opcode, which represents the particular machine-level operation to be carried out.

For example, in the x86 assembly language:

```assembly
MOV AX, 5
```

Here, "MOV" is the opcode, indicating a move operation. The opcode "MOV" instructs the CPU to move the immediate value 5 into the AX register.

Opcodes are specific to the architecture and instruction set of the CPU. They are typically represented by mnemonic codes in assembly language, providing a more human-readable form for programmers, which is then translated into binary machine code that the CPU can execute. The combination of opcodes and operands forms the complete machine instruction, dictating the exact operation to be performed by the CPU.
