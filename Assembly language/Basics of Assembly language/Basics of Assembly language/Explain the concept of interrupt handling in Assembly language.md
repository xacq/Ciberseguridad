## Interrupt Handling in Assembly Language

Interrupt handling is a crucial aspect of system programming, allowing a computer to respond to external events or signals promptly. In assembly language, interrupt handling involves managing the transfer of control from the current executing program to a special routine known as an interrupt service routine (ISR). Here's an explanation of the key concepts related to interrupt handling in assembly language:

### 1. **Interrupt Basics:**
   - **Definition:** An interrupt is a mechanism that suspends the normal execution of a program to transfer control to a specific routine in response to a particular event.
   - **Events:** Interrupts can be triggered by hardware events (e.g., I/O completion, timer expiration) or software events (e.g., system calls, exceptions).

### 2. **Interrupt Vector Table (IVT):**
   - **IVT Overview:** The Interrupt Vector Table is a data structure that associates each interrupt or exception with the memory address of its corresponding ISR.
   - **Location:** The IVT is typically stored in a fixed location in memory, and each entry corresponds to a specific interrupt number or type.

### 3. **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR):**
   - **Definition:** An ISR is a special routine designed to handle a specific interrupt.
   - **Execution:** When an interrupt occurs, the CPU transfers control to the corresponding ISR.
   - **Completion:** After executing the ISR, control returns to the interrupted program.

### 4. **Interrupt Request (IRQ):**
   - **Definition:** An IRQ is a hardware signal generated by peripheral devices or internal components to request attention from the CPU.
   - **Priority:** IRQs are often assigned priorities, and the CPU services them based on priority levels.

### 5. **Interrupt Enable and Disable:**
   - **Control:** The ability to enable or disable interrupts is essential for managing interrupt handling.
   - **Interrupt Enable Flag (IF):** A flag in the CPU's status register that controls whether interrupts are enabled or disabled.
   - **CLI and STI Instructions:** Assembly instructions to clear (CLI) or set (STI) the Interrupt Enable Flag.

### 6. **Interrupt Handling Process:**
   - **Normal Execution:** The CPU executes instructions from the main program.
   - **Interrupt Request:** An external event triggers an interrupt request (IRQ).
   - **Interrupt Acknowledgment:** The CPU acknowledges the interrupt and temporarily halts the current program.
   - **Context Saving:** The CPU automatically saves the current context (e.g., register values) before transferring control to the ISR.
   - **ISR Execution:** The ISR is executed, addressing the specific interrupt.
   - **Context Restoration:** After ISR execution, the CPU restores the saved context.
   - **Return to Main Program:** Control returns to the interrupted program, resuming normal execution.

### 7. **Exception Handling:**
   - **Definition:** Exceptions are a type of interrupt that signals abnormal conditions or errors during program execution.
   - **Examples:** Division by zero, page faults, and invalid opcode are examples of exceptions.

### 8. **Priority Handling:**
   - **Priority Levels:** Some systems support multiple interrupt priority levels.
   - **Priority Schemes:** Interrupts with higher priority levels are serviced before those with lower priority levels.

### 9. **Maskable and Non-Maskable Interrupts:**
   - **Maskable:** Interrupts that can be temporarily ignored or disabled using the Interrupt Enable Flag.
   - **Non-Maskable (NMI):** Interrupts that cannot be masked and always demand immediate attention.

### 10. **Interrupt Context Switching:**
   - **Definition:** Switching from the interrupted program to the ISR involves context switching.
   - **Context Preservation:** The CPU must preserve the context of the interrupted program before executing the ISR.

In assembly language, handling interrupts involves writing ISR code, configuring the IVT, and managing the interrupt enable/disable state. Assembly instructions for enabling or disabling interrupts, loading the IVT, and context switching play a crucial role in effective interrupt handling.

In summary, interrupt handling in assembly language is a fundamental mechanism that enables a computer system to respond to external events efficiently. It requires careful coordination between the hardware and software components to ensure proper context switching and seamless integration of interrupt service routines.
