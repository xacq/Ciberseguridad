The provided Ruby code is a simulation of a Blind Birthday Attack on a reduced 32-bit HMAC-SHA256. The goal of this attack is to find two different messages that produce the same HMAC (a collision) by exploiting the Birthday Paradox. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the code:

### Overview
- **HMAC**: Hash-based Message Authentication Code, a cryptographic function that produces a fixed-size output.
- **Oracle**: A function that, given two inputs, tells us how many bits of their HMACs match.
- **Tree**: Used to organize the messages and facilitate the search for collisions.

### Key Components

1. **Constants and HMAC Function**:
   ```ruby
   HMAC_BITS = 32

   def hmac(key, message)
     return OpenSSL::HMAC::digest('SHA256', key, message)[0, HMAC_BITS/8]
   end
   ```
   - `HMAC_BITS` is set to 32, meaning the HMAC output is truncated to 32 bits (4 bytes).
   - The `hmac` function generates a truncated 32-bit HMAC using SHA256 and the OpenSSL library.

2. **Oracle**:
   ```ruby
   KEY = SecureRandom.random_bytes(32)

   def oracle(a, b)
     h1 = hmac(KEY, a)
     h2 = hmac(KEY, b)
     h1_binary = h1.bytes.map { |c| c.to_s(2).rjust(8,'0') }.join('').split('')
     h2_binary = h2.bytes.map { |c| c.to_s(2).rjust(8,'0') }.join('').split('')
     0.upto(HMAC_BITS - 1) do |i|
       if h1_binary[i] != h2_binary[i]
         return i
       end
     end
     return HMAC_BITS
   end
   ```
   - `KEY` is a 256-bit random secret key.
   - The `oracle` function takes two messages, computes their HMACs, and returns the number of leading matching bits.
   - It converts the HMACs to binary strings and compares them bit by bit.

3. **TreeNode Class**:
   ```ruby
   class TreeNode
     attr_accessor :message, :left, :right
   end
   ```
   - `TreeNode` represents a node in the binary search tree.
   - Each node stores a message and has pointers to left and right children.

4. **Random Message Generator**:
   ```ruby
   def random
     return SecureRandom.random_bytes(32)
   end
   ```
   - `random` generates a 32-byte random message.

5. **Attack Implementation**:
   ```ruby
   def attack
     root = TreeNode.new
     root.message = random()

     queries = 0
     tree_size = 0
     closest = 0

     loop do
       newnode = TreeNode.new
       newnode.message = random()
       current = root
       matching = 0

       loop do
         thismatch = oracle(current.message, newnode.message)
         queries += 1

         if thismatch > closest
           closest = thismatch
           puts "Closest collision so far: #{thismatch}"
           puts "Tree size: #{tree_size}"
         end

         if thismatch == HMAC_BITS && current.message != newnode.message
           puts "Found a collision amongst #{tree_size} in #{queries} queries!"
           puts "Message 1: #{current.message.unpack("H*")[0]}"
           puts "Message 2: #{newnode.message.unpack("H*")[0]}"
           return
         end

         if thismatch > matching
           if current.right.nil?
             current.right = newnode
             tree_size += 1
             break
           end
           current = current.right
         else
           if current.left.nil?
             current.left = newnode
             tree_size += 1
             break
           end
           current = current.left
         end

         matching += 1
       end
     end
   end

   attack()
   ```

   ### Step-by-Step Explanation:
   1. **Initialization**:
      - A random message is generated and added as the root of the tree.
      - Counters (`queries`, `tree_size`, `closest`) are initialized to track the attack progress.

   2. **Main Loop**:
      - The attack runs in an infinite loop, continually adding new messages to the tree.
      - For each new message, a new `TreeNode` is created.

   3. **Tree Traversal**:
      - Starting from the root, the new message is compared with the current node's message using the `oracle`.
      - The number of matching bits (`thismatch`) is determined.
      - If `thismatch` is greater than any previous match (`closest`), it's updated and printed.

   4. **Collision Detection**:
      - If all `HMAC_BITS` (32 bits) match and the messages are different, a collision is found, and the program stops.
      - The matching bit length determines the direction in the tree:
        - If the (matching+1)st bit matches, move right.
        - Otherwise, move left.
      - If the corresponding child node is `nil`, the new node is added at that position.

   5. **Termination**:
      - The attack continues until a collision is found, printing the details of the collision when it occurs.

### Key Concepts:
- **Oracle Usage**: The oracle helps in efficiently navigating the tree by providing the number of matching HMAC bits, reducing the expected queries.
- **Tree Structure**: The binary tree is used to systematically organize messages, ensuring that all possible HMAC prefixes are explored.
- **Collision Search**: The goal is to exploit the Birthday Paradox, expecting to find a collision after around \(2^{16}\) messages (since HMAC_BITS is 32).

This code is a proof of concept and works due to the reduced HMAC size. In real-world scenarios, the HMAC would be much larger (e.g., 256 bits), making such attacks impractical.
