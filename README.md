## Understanding Ethical Hacking

Ethical hacking, also known as penetration testing or white-hat hacking, involves the use of hacking techniques to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in computer systems, networks, and applications. The goal is to strengthen security by identifying and fixing potential exploits before malicious hackers can take advantage of them.

## Ethics

Ethical hacking is conducted in accordance with strict ethical guidelines. It is essential to obtain proper authorization before testing any system, and all testing should be carried out with the goal of improving security and protecting against potential threats.
